# Analyzing_Acidity_California-Current-System

This was my final project for a graduate level data analysis course under Dr. Yuhan Wang. I explored my own question: 
<i>How do pH fluctuations differ between two regimes -- before 1980 and after 1980 -- in the model dataset from NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory? </i>
The results of the analysis support the hypothesis that NATURAL IMPACTS on ocean pH in the California Current System were stronger prior to 1980 and ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS were stronger after 1980.
